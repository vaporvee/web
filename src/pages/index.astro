				Hello my name is <b>Yannik</b>!<br />
				Iâ€™m a 20 year old <b>Game Developer</b> living <b>in Germany</b
				>.<br />
				I mostly code in C++, Godot Engine's GDScript and C#.<br />
				I am mostly self taught but i cant really say when i began to learn
				game developement.<br />
				Currently i already work at a game studio and i also have my own
				game side projects and tools.<br />
				This website will mostly have docs, tutorials, and showcasing of
				my projects.<br />
				Maybe also some other stuff all around the creative process of game
				developement or completely unrelated stuff like cooking recepies
				;)
