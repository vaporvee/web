:::deter{title="Important plugin explaination"}
**This is for the Discord Game SDK NOT the Embedded App SDK** <br/>
Any mention of "SDK" has nothing to do with making Discord voice channel activities. <br/>
Its only to display your game in a Discord user's profile with extra information and some other features.
:::

:::note{title="Discord Game SDK information"}
The GameSDK's Achievements, Applications, Voice, Images, Lobbies, Networking, Storage, and Store (purchases and discounts) features have been deprecated and will not be added. <br /> However the rest is and will still be supported by Discord.
:::

<br/>
:::assert{title="Keep in mind"}
To make anything work in the plugin make sure to run

 ```gdscript
 func _process(_delta):
     DiscordRPC.run_callbacks()
 ```

 This happens normaly inside the Autoload wich should be automatically added by the plugin. <br />
 Something that does **not get added automatically** is your `app_id{:gdscript}`. It is also mandatory to be able to use anything in the plugin.

 ```gdscript
 DiscordRPC.app_id = #<your Application ID>
 ```

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <ol type="1"><li>Open the AssetLib tab in your Godot Editor.</li><li>Search for "discord" and install all the files from this plugin <img width="30px" style="margin-top:-30px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaporvee/discord-rpc-godot/main/project/assets/Logo_V2_Clyde.png" /></li></ol> | <ol type="1"><li>[Download the addon](https://github.com/vaporvee/discord-rpc-godot/releases/latest/download/ADDON-discord-rpc-godot.zip/)</li><li>Put the `addons/` folder in the root of your Godot project</li></ol> |

3. Enable the addon in your Project Settings under "Plugins" and "DiscordRPC". <br /><sub>(Also adds DiscordRPCLoader autoload wich should be ignored. It needs to run in the background to comunicate with the Discord client)</sub>
4. Restart your project with the window that should now appear. <br /><img src="https://github.com/vaporvee/discord-rpc-godot/assets/80621863/620d90aa-6e76-4a80-980e-c8c57d8cfa58" width="200px" /><br />
5. Create an Application under https://discord.com/developers/applications and get the Application ID
6. While you're here, head to the "OAuth2" section of your application and add `http://127.0.0.1` as a redirect URI for your application.<br /><sub>(Discord says you should do that but it doesn't change anything)</sub>
7. (optional) Set images under "Rich Presence" and "Art Assets" and remember the keys
8. Create a gdscript wich gets run for example at startup wich looks something like the following

```gdscript
extends Node

func _ready():
	DiscordRPC.app_id = 1099618430065324082 # Application ID
	DiscordRPC.details = "A demo activity by vaporvee"
	DiscordRPC.state = "Checkpoint 23/23"

	DiscordRPC.large_image = "example_game" # Image key from "Art Assets"
	DiscordRPC.large_image_text = "Try it now!"
	DiscordRPC.small_image = "boss" # Image key from "Art Assets"
	DiscordRPC.small_image_text = "Fighting the end boss! D:"

	DiscordRPC.start_timestamp = int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()) # "02:46 elapsed"
	# DiscordRPC.end_timestamp = int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()) + 3600 # +1 hour in unix time / "01:00:00 remaining"

	DiscordRPC.refresh() # Always refresh after changing the values!
```

**Then it will look similar to this:**

# Troubleshooting
First of all try reinstalling the plugin and restart both your Godot Editor and your Discord client.
<details><summary><b>I have no errors in my Godot console from the plugin but my Activity doesn't show up in my Discord Client.</b></summary>Make sure a `DiscordRPC.run_callbacks()` function runs in a `_process(delta)` function. This should happen in the Autoload added by the plugin. If it still doesn't help, try the Demo above. If still nothing appears in your Discord profile card, you have to reset the depending settings in you Discord or reinstall it.</details>
<details><summary><b>I have a lot of `DiscordRPC not declared` errors spammed in my Godot Console and i can't use the plugin.</b></summary> Make sure the plugin is actually enabled. Then the plugin should work and after the second restart you shouldn't get any errors from the plugin. But if it still gives you the errors delete the file `/addons/discord-rpc-gd/bin/.gdignore` and restart the editor manually.</details>
