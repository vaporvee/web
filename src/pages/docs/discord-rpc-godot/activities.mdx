# Variables

Anything of course begins with `DiscordRPC.{:gdscript}` e.g. `DiscordRPC.app_id = #<your Application ID>{:gdscript}`
### Rich presence

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app_id{:gdscript}` | `int{:gdscript}` | The Application ID you need to get to make anything in the plugin → https://discord.com/developers/applications |
| `details{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | The first text line visible in the Activity (after the app name) |
| `state{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | The second text line visible in the Activity |
| `large_image{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | Key for the large image you set while uploading an image to the "Rich Presence" → "Art Assets" tab in your online Discord dev panel |
| `large_image_text{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | Text wich shows when you hover over the large image |
| `small_image{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | Key for the small image you set while uploading an image to the "Rich Presence" → "Art Assets" tab in your online Discord dev panel |
| `small_image_text{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | Text wich shows when you hover over the small image |
| `start_timestamp{:gdscript}` | `int{:gdscript}` | The "02:46 elapsed" timestamp in the presence. Get the current time with Godot's `int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()){:gdscript}` and Discord counts in seconds from it |
| `end_timestamp{:gdscript}` | `int{:gdscript}` | The "59:59 elapsed" timestamp in the presence. Get it with Godot's `int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()){:gdscript}` and add seconds as int e.g. `+ 3600{:gdscript}` → + 1 Hour |

### Invite system
The values can be pretty anything since there is no lobby system in the SDK anymore. You should already have a custom lobby system wich can compute the secret and change the values. After an invite every value should be the same as the other player.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `party_id{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | Unique identifier for the party |
| `current_party_size{:gdscript}` | `int{:gdscript}` | The current playercount in the party |
| `max_party_size{:gdscript}` | `int{:gdscript}` | Maximum allowed playercount in the party |
| `match_secret{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | Unique hash for the given match context |
| `join_secret{:gdscript}` | `String {:gdscript}` | Unique hash for chat invites and Ask to Join |
| `spectate_secret{:gdscript}` | `String{:gdscript}` | Unique hash for Spectate button |
| `is_public_party{:gdscript}` | `bool{:gdscript}` | Turn it to `true{:gdscript}` if you want people to join the party without asking. This needs to be enabled in the Discord user settings |
| `instanced{:gdscript}` | `bool{:gdscript}` | Whether this activity is an instanced context, like a match |

# Methods
### Refresh
After setting any variables you have to reload the RPC with this method
```gdscript
DiscordRPC.refresh()
```
### Clear
Disables the Activity.
```gdscript
DiscordRPC.clear(reset_values)
```
**Taken variable:** `bool reset_values{:gdscript}` **Standard value:** `false{:gdscript}`<br/>
When turning `reset_values{:gdscript}` to `true{:gdscript}` it completely clears the whole activity with its `app_id{:gdscript}` and other values.

### Unclear
Reenables the before cleared Activity. Only works with `DiscordRPC.clear(reset_values = false){:gdscript}`(default).
```gdscript
DiscordRPC.unclear()
```
