# How to build

1. Clone the project
2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install scons via pip with

```sh
pip install scons
```

and make sure to put scons on your PATH or replace "scons" with a scons run command<br/>

<br />
4. Run this command ```sh python setup.py ``` 5. and build the project with ```sh
python build.py ``` There is a prompt how it should start Godot (if `godot` is on
PATH) to test the addon fast directly.
<br />

**or** run

```sh
scons
```

and

```sh
scons target=template_release
```

<br />

6. Now the addon should be installed in the project folder of the repo and can be exported with

```sh
python release.py
```
