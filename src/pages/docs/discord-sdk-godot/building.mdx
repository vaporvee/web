# How to build
1. Clone the project
2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install scons via pip with
```sh
pip install scons
```
and make sure to put scons on your PATH or replace "scons" with a scons run command<br/>
<br/>
4. Run this command
```sh
python setup.py
```
5. and build the project with
```sh
python build.py
```
There is a prompt how it should start Godot (if `godot` is on PATH) to test the addon fast directly.
<br/>

**or** run
```sh
scons
```
and
```sh
scons target=template_release
```
<br/>

6. Now the addon should be installed in the project folder of the repo and can be exported with
```sh
python release.py
```
# MacOS Support
:::warn
MacOS is supported but not included in this project releases. <br/>
You have to build it yourself because signing costs money we don't want to pay currently.<br/>
You have to sign the binding dylib to use it. The official Discord Game SDK dylib is already signed by Discord.<br/>
It should be possible to run the dylib for testing before signing it but i haven't tested it yet.<br/>
