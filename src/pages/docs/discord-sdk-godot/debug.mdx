The ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaporvee/discord-sdk-godot/main/project/addons/discord-sdk-gd/Debug.svg)`DiscordSDKDebug` Node shows the current status of the SDK and its values.<br/>
You can also print the `current_user` Dictionary or the whole friendslist Array on the console and manage invites with the Button and input LineEdits. You can also disable and enable the Activity with the button switch.
